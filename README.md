curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4="  -d @'<JSON_PAYLOAD>' -k -v https://<LOGANALYZER_HOST>:<LOGANALYZER_HTTPS_PORT>/api/logs/publish
```
Note that it is mandatory to set the `@logstream` field in the event, otherwise all the events will get stored  under a default log category.
This `logstream` field is stored as a facet data type. You could read more about facet data type from [facet data type documentation] (https://docs.wso2.com/display/DAS300/Searching+Data+By+Categories#SearchingDataByCategories-FacetsFacets)

Basic Authorization header is in the form of base64encoded  username:password

## publish log events using logstash 

you can use http out put plugin to publish log events to log analyzer

http Example

```
    http{
         http_method => "post"
         url => "http://localhost:9763/api/logs/publish"
         headers => ["Authorization", "Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4="]
    }
```

Optionally you could transfer events via ssl using corresponding logstash configurations

# Timestamp configuration

Inorder to use time range search queries, you should configure a proper timestamp in to the log event. You can use the default @timestamp in logstash.
In case the log timestamp is not ISO8601 compatible, you can convert the time stamp to a long value and set it in @timestamp_long field
 
#### Converting a timestamp to a long value

```
filter {
    ruby {
        code => "
                # yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
                event['@timestamp_long'] = Time.parse(event['message']).to_i
    
        "
    }
}
```
